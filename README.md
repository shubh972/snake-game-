Snake Game Using Python Turtle This project is a classic Snake game implemented using Python's Turtle graphics module. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food, which causes the snake to grow in length. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

Features: Interactive Gameplay: Use the keyboard to control the snake's direction (WASD keys). Dynamic Scoring: Keeps track of the current score and the highest score achieved. Collision Detection: The game detects collisions with the walls and the snake's own body, ending the game appropriately. Random Food Placement: The food appears at random locations on the screen each time the snake eats it. Technologies Used: Python Turtle graphics module How to Play: Run the script. Use the WASD keys to control the snake: W: Up A: Left S: Down D: Right Eat the food to grow the snake and increase your score. Avoid colliding with the walls and the snake's own body. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of game development, including animation, event handling, and collision detection using Python.
